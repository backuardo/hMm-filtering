hMm - hidden Markov model
---

RoboMaze.py
---
This class is responsible for generating a 4 x 4 maze with n randomly 
placed walls, and randomly coloring the maze positions red, green, blue, or 
yellow. It also generates a random sequence of steps a robot took, and can 
display the maze.

MarkovFilter.py
---
This class implements filtering on a RoboMaze object.

test.py
---
This file runs a few different tests with varying numbers of walls and 
varying lengths of sequence. The maze and sequence are randomly generated 
each time the code is ran, so the test cases will produce different results 
each time.
